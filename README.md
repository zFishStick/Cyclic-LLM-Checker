# ðŸ”ƒ Cyclic-LLM-Checker
Repository for the "Semantic web &amp; Social network" Project. Here there are all the information regarding the methodology used, the used datasets and an exploration of the datasets used for the project.

## ðŸ”Ž Exploration of the datasets
The exploration of the datasets can be found in the ```notebooks``` folder. To run the notebooks, you can use VSCode with the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension installed.


## ðŸ“š Methodology proposed
The methodology proposed is a cyclic verification between two LLMs: Gemini and DeepSeek. The process is as follows:
1. The user provides an input to Gemini.
2. Gemini generates an output.
3. DeepSeek evaluates Gemini's output to verify its reliability.
4. If the output is reliable, it is returned to the user.
5. If the output is not verified, DeepSeek generates a new output based on Gemini's output.
6. The output is evaluated by Gemini.
7. Gemini performs the same process as DeepSeek to verify the new output.
8. Loop until the output is reliable.
Note: to avoid infinite loops, a maximum number of iterations is set to a predefined value.
The main goal of this methodology is to leverage the strengths of both LLMs to improve the reliability of the outputs provided to the user, in order to minimize the risk of misinformation.
